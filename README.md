# Prog 9 Assignments

## First assignment: Design Patterns
I chose to do this assignment in Typescript. 

## Second assignment: Progressive Web App
Tried building a simple PWA.
I used these tutorials to get to my current result:

- https://developers.google.com/web/ilt/pwa/caching-files-with-service-worker

## Thrid assignment: AI in Games
I tried upgrading the intellect of the unicorns (horses in chess) by adding the minimax functionality to the game, including an evaluation of the movements and (really needed) alpha-beta pruning in order to speed up the process!.
I used these tutorials to get to my current result:
- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimax-algorithm-in-game-theory-set-1-introduction/
- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimax-algorithm-in-game-theory-set-2-evaluation-function/
- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimax-algorithm-in-game-theory-set-3-tic-tac-toe-ai-finding-optimal-move/

I also used these explanations for the additional learning goals:

## Fourth assignment: IoT
For this assignment, I've tried to implement a simple led loop combined with speed changes on button press. Tilting the circuit playground will cause it to print something in the console (or serial monitor).
